# WealthStone

[![BrowserStack Status](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/badge.svg?badge_key=<badge_key>)](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/public-build/<badge_key>)

This WealthStone real estate investment company WordPress theme, based on Zurb's [Foundation for Sites 6](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html). The theme began with [FoundationPress](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/) a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design.

## Requirements

**This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v6.x.x 11.6.x to be installed on your machine.** Please be aware that you might encounter problems with the installation if you are using the most current Node version (bleeding edge) with all the latest features.

WealthStone uses [Sass](http://Sass-lang.com/) (CSS with superpowers). In short, Sass is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy.

The Sass is compiled using libsass, which requires the GCC to be installed on your machine. Windows users can install it through [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), and Mac users can install it through the [Xcode Command-line Tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

If you have not worked with a Sass-based workflow before, I would recommend reading [FoundationPress for beginners](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/posts/tutorials/foundationpress-for-beginners), a short blog post that explains what you need to know.

The theme also requires several plugins: [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), [Ninja Forms](http://ninjaforms.com/) and [Safe SVG](https://wpsvg.com/).
